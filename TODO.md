# TODO List

## TODOs

- add export function
- add multiple states and a timeline (like bookmarks but for tweening)
- add bookmarks (for timelines or current state of track editor)
- add history of timeline
- add history of track editor (good thing we only update after drag)
- reorder skaters so that skaters with focus are rendered before others, so the handle is visible during overlap
- give skaters a solid id, not by order
- choose better colors
- change font for blocker label
- add view (modal? popup? route?) for three js
- add buttons for changing the orientation (+90, 180, 270 degree)
- create track in three js
- create models for skaters in 3D (cylinder, later realistic skater model if possible)
- add poses to 3d skater models (could use a different view for the 2d editor, or make edit possible in 3d, maybe tab cycle or mouse click, or maybe add little icon on the top right of the skater to depict what stance they have)
- add possibility to make a brace if skaters are near enough (auto brace? little wiggly arms?)
- load skater data/models/positions into the scene
- add screenshot option for easier save (download blob? screenshot api? render to canvas? render svg to canvas to jpg?)
- add cooperation mode (node server for live interaction? everyone with link?)
- save options?
- add options for skaters, like height and such for specific scenarios
- add option for camera height for smaller/taller skaters (benefits?)
- add VR option, so you can move camera / skater around the track
- add collision detection of 3D models (cylinder first, realistic skater model later)

## Done

X show direction indicators on skaters (Not phallic arrows, but fov cone) -> Shield
X Add collision handling for circles
X add possibility to rotate skaters (click focus, show handles for turning)
X add state handling
